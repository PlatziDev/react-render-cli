CLI app to render React components to strings and output the result on console.

It don't support JSX, ES2015/6 & ES2016/7, you need the send the transpiled file to a Node.js 4.2.1 compatible code.

## Installation
```bash
[sudo] npm i -g react-render-cli
```

## Usage
```bash
Usage: react-render [component path]

Options:

  -h, --help           output usage information
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -p, --props [props]  Props to pass into the component (JSON string)
  -s, --static         If the markup is static (without data-reactid)
```

## Examples
### Without props
```bash
react-render MyComponent.jsx
```

#### Static markup
```bash
react-render MyComponent.jsx -s
```

### With props
```bash
react-render MyComponent.jsx -p '{"text":"Hello World"}'
```

#### Static markup

react-render MyComponent.jsx -p '{"text":"Hello World"}' -s
```

## Build binary
If you need a performance boost you can build a binary application usign the command:

```

```

This will output a *react-render-cli* file with Node.js incorpored. The binary can run in almost half of the time.
